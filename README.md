*The Provider Visualization Tool (PVT)* is available as a web application with mobile app development in progress. The purpose of the Provider Visualization Tool is to provide accurate and real-time metrics for medical service providers within a particular geographical location. The control rules applied to these metrics can be changed by the administrator for any location and any time frame. For an accurate representation of data, an adjustable 18-month time span is recommended.
